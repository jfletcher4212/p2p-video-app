Peer-to-Peer Video Chat
=================

# Usage:

When the user visits the site and grants permission to use their webcam and microphone, they are able to pick a room name and connect with one other user. They are able to chat via text, see their own webcam, and send their webcam and audio input/microphone to each other.

## Known Issues/Planned Updates:

* Data Sanitization needs to be implemented on all user input. 
* Video Streaming needs to be implemented
* UX needs to be improved.
* Newlines in input should be removed before sending to server.

## To do next time:
* Continue working on data sanitization and various user input problems.
