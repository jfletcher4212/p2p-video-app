Peer-to-Peer Video Chat
=================

# Usage:

When the user visits the site and grants permission to use their webcam and microphone, they are able to pick a room name and connect with one other user. They are able to chat via text, see their own webcam, and send their webcam and audio input/microphone to each other.

## Known Issues/Planned Updates:

* Video Streaming needs to be implemented
* UX needs to be improved.

## To do next time:
* Bug fixing/code revision. Look into implementing webRTC
